What a generic start to my blog.

I wonder how many other programmers started their blogs off with a post with the exact same title as this? <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=hello+world" target="_blank">Googling it</a> didn't really help. Oh well, just curious.

If you're reading this wondering why I'm ranting about how lame this post is, that's great! It's lame because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" target="_blank"><em>Hello World</em></a> is a traditional first program to write, and is something every code monkey has probably written in some form or another.

If I were to label myself and my intention for this blog with two words those words would be <em>curious</em> and <em>creative</em>. Plus you know: tallish, sleep deprived, unintentionally judgey, and reasonable draw-er.

If nothing else I hope my writing inspires curiousity and critical thinking, and at the end of the day: questions.
