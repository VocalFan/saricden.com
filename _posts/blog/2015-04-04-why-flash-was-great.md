I'm all for open standards and what not, but before Flash is gone I want to make a few points as to why it was brilliant.

As a tool for creating rich interactive web applications (particularly games) Flash really was in a class of it's own.

A single tool in which you could make beautiful graphics, animate them, dynamically integrate sound, and code your logic.
That's a pretty amazing combo. All in one place. Personally I don't think you <em>need</em> more than that.

Keeping things loosely coupled though, is 9 times out of 10 a best practice.
Say you didn't like the drawing tools in Flash and you'd rather use something else.
You'd probably disagree with me about Flash's excellence.

Ultimately HTML5 is the way to go. The simple fact that you don't need to pay makes HTML5 far more accessible.
Not to mention the inherit support to create cross platform, mobile friendly applications.

There are already great strides in HTML5 game development, and that's only going to continue with time.
A perfect example is <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>.

Perhaps Flash will find a new niche. Even if it doesn't however, I hope the world will remember it fondly.

Thank you and good night!
