Let me get one thing straight. I don't think libraries or frameworks are bad. Not by any means.

Libraries can be powerful tools for providing generic reusable functionality, and frameworks offer the additional benifit of a provided structural paradigm for your code (pretty much essential when working in teams).

I do not think however, they should be used by beginner programmers.

The reason I take issue with beginners using them is that because they simplify what's going on in the background, there isn't an obvious need to learn how it actually works.

A brilliant site that is full of examples for jQuery is <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">youmightnotneedjquery.com</a>.

The problem with not understanding the fundementals of anything is when it comes time to think outside the box, it will be very hard to do so.

I myself experienced this by learning how to do database joins with <a href="http://propelorm.org/">Propel ORM</a> instead of raw SQL. While it worked at the time, when I was faced with a situation where raw SQL joins were required it was very challenging.

I guess my sentiment here is that if you're doing something you haven't done before, try to figure it out without any helpers first. Get a sense for what's actually going on in the background.

There's little harm in using helper tools when you know what they're doing and it saves you time, but the helper tools should always be learned second.
