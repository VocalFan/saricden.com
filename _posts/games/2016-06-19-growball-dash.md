  Growball Dash was the first game of mine to ever get kind of popular. For a while it was getting about 200 - 300 plays per day in Saudi Arabia. Not sure why it got popular there, but by the time Mochimedia shut down, it had roughly 50,000 plays in total. The game is very simple, you move a ball with your mouse, collecting stars, while avoiding a red ball that follows you. The catch is the more stars you collect, the bigger your ball becomes.<br>
