  Red 7 is a Flash game I made for a 1-day game making challenge. The entire game was created in less than 24 hours. It's a simple dodging game where you pilot a spaceship with the mouse and dodge asteroids that fall at increasing speeds, and if you survive long enough there might be more danger...<br>
