      Designstor is a creative technology and visualization company. The site utilizes a variety of front-end technologies to create a beautiful user experience, both on a desktop computer as well as mobile devices. I worked on this project while working at The Pixel Shop in Toronto, Ontario. The website was designed by Tim Smith and Vivian So, the development was done by Stacie DaPonte, Patrick McCreanor, and myself. The website has since been updated, but you can still check it out with the link below.<br>
