  Empower Health Research is a database system designed to enable clinicians, doctors, patients, and a variety of other roles work together on a large variety of clinical trials. This piece of software includes an advanced form builder, enabling users to create form templates and instances that can be later filled out by patients. All changes to patient forms are tracked in a detailed audit log. Additionally customized reports can be run on a multitude of data points in each of the many studies.

  I worked on this project with the wonderful Hassen Ben Tanfous and Jason Hanley while working for Syllogistic Software Inc. The back-end utilizes the PHP MVC framework Symfony, while the front-end is written in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.<br>
