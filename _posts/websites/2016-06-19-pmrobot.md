<p>
  PMRobot was full suite of project management tools, all built into one simple to use solution. Some of it's features included a bug, feature, and change ticketing system, time tracking, client / co-worker messaging, and file sharing.

  I worked on this project during my time at Syllogistic Software Inc. alongside Jason Hanley and Hassen Ben Tanfous. This project was written using the PHP MVC framework Symfony, alongside a multitude of front-end libraries and languages.
