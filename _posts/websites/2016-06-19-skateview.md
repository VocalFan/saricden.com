Skateview was a website designed to enable skaters to find and explore new skate parks digitally. The site contained virtual tours of skate parks in Ontario.

The plan was to travel the world and map out as many skate parks as possible, however I didn't really take into account how big of a challenge this would be in itself.

The site is no longer online, however you can still view the code and check out the screenshots here!
