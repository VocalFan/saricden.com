Developer by day, developer by night. I'm obessesed with the applications of randomization and automation and I love a good problem to solve. My favorite kind of wrap is turkey.

It's nice you want to know more about me, so here's a bit of backstory:

I've wanted to make games for as long as I can remember. I'm pretty sure the game that inspired me way back when I was 8 years old was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages" target="_blank">Zelda the Oracle of Seasons</a>.

When I was 12 (I think) I went to an awesome summer camp put on by an awesome company called <a href="http://www.bytecamp.ca/" target="_blank">Byte Camp</a> where I made my first ever flash game (unfortunately long gone).

From 2008 on I developed and released a number of flash games under the name *saricDen*. Life is a funny thing though, and as luck would have it in 2011 I landed a job as an assistant instructor at Byte Camp teaching the very summer camps that sparked my passion when I was young.

I went to university for a while, and learned a lot about serverside development while working remotely at <a href="http://www.syllogisticsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Syllogistic Software Inc.</a> In 2014 I moved to Toronto, Ontario and became a (at least sort of) regular at a group called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Coffee-Code/" target="_blank">Coffee and Code</a> where I met a ton of awesome, like-minded people. The same year I got a job working alongside the lovely folk at <a href="http://thepixelshop.ca/" target="_blank">The Pixel Shop</a> as a UI Developer.

I'm still in Toronto working hard, but plan on moving home to BC in June and getting back into the whole school thing.

I'll keep this page updated as I go, thanks for reading! :)
