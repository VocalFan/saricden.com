                        <p>Hey people! My name is Kirk and I'm a 21 year old software developer living in Toronto, Ontario.
                        I truly love the creative possibilities that programming enables, and enjoy making everything from web apps to video games.</p>
                        <p>Other things I like include skateboarding, playing guitar, and hanging out playing Skyrim with my cool girlfriend.
                        My favorite game series is Zelda, TV show is currently Brooklyn 99, and wrap is turkey.</p>
                        <p>Anyways I feel like I've been talking about myself too much, so that's the end of my about page!</p>
