So you need to enable Javascript please.

The internet is full of some truly amazing works of art made possible by programmers working very hard. By roaming around without Javascript enabled you're basically saying "No, I don't really care for anything at all neat, or useful. I'm just here to read some words and perhaps look at a few pictures. Anything beyond that is frankly witchcraft and I didn't like Harry Potter."

Please, do yourself and the world a favour, download the latest version of [Chrome][chrome] and don't touch any of the default settings.

Thank you and have a nice day.

If you came here by opening my menu in a new tab or you're a robot, surprise!!
