      <h1>What are <em>Open Games</em>?</h1>
      <p>
        An open game is a game that was <em>made freely to be played freely.</em>

      <h2>I'm <em>Saric</em> and this is my <em>den</em>!</h2>
      <p>Well hello there, thanks for stopping by my website!</p>
      <p>It's a work in progress but I'm certainly working on it :) (and heck, I like it that way)</p>
      <p>This is the part where I talk about myself and try to convince you of how awesome a guy I am, so here goes:</p>
      <p>My name is Kirk, I was born and raised in Victoria, BC (aka the Cali of Canada ;)). Make no mistake I'm very very aware of how lucky I am to call British Columbia my home... I've travelled a lot, and through the ups and down, I'm always happy to return home to my strange patch of northerly rainforest.</p>
